# Snake-Water-Gun-game
This Python program is a **Snake-Water-Gun** game. The user picks `"s"` (Snake), `"w"` (Water), or `"g"` (Gun), while the computer randomly selects one. The game compares choices and declares the winner based on predefined rules. However, the program lacks input validation, which may cause a crash if the user enters an invalid choice.
